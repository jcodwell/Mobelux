1. To Run App 
    : python manage.py runserver



Approach: 
 Models: 
    Photo 
    Album 
    User
    Explanation of Model Relantionships:  
        As User I want to be able to upload many photos to an album.
        Implementing a Many to Many relantionship, in addition each User
        can have many Albums and as such will need a one-to-many relantionship.

        For ease of implementation I used the already provided Django Admin User Model
        to assign the current user. 

        I used the default db provided by Django
    Notes on Testing: 
        This app features a couple of unit tests, one integration test I would included is testing
        the functionality between album and photos.     

    Future Implementation: 
         Designing the relantionship as stated above would allow for future implemations
         for the front-end. 

         For example, In react I can fetch the API, using query param filter and render 
         component based on logged in user

         In additon, I can used classed based-view(Django Rest Framework) to reduce time/coding
         basing crud implementaions. 
         DRF also would offer a better enviroment for customizeablilty..For more complex features
